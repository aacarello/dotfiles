# The latest version as installed by the Cygwin Setup program can
# always be found at /etc/defaults/etc/skel/.bashrc

# Modifying /etc/skel/.bashrc directly will prevent

# The copy in your home directory (~/.bashrc) is yours, please

# Shell Options
#
# See man bash for more options...
#
# Don't wait for job termination notification
set -o notify
#
# Don't use ^D to exit
# set -o ignoreeof
#
# Use case-insensitive filename globbing
shopt -s nocaseglob
#
# Make bash append rather than overwrite the history on disk
# shopt -s histappend
#
# When changing directory small typos can be ignored by bash
# for example, cd /vr/lgo/apaache would find /var/log/apache

# Completion options
#
# These completion tuning parameters change the default behavior of bash_completion:
#
# Define to access remotely checked-out files over passwordless ssh for CVS
# COMP_CVS_REMOTE=1
#
# Define to avoid stripping description in --option=description of './configure --help'
# COMP_CONFIGURE_HINTS=1
#
# Define to avoid flattening internal contents of tar files
# COMP_TAR_INTERNAL_PATHS=1
#
# Uncomment to turn on programmable completion enhancements.
# Any completions you add in ~/.bash_completion are sourced last.

# History Options
# ###############
# HISTCONTROL (man 1 bash)
# ignoreboth    causes Bash not to store duplicate commands in history.
# ignorespace   to use a space to precede any command you don't want to remember in history.
# ignoredups    setting ignores repeated lines
# erasedups If that's set, no duplicates get entered in bash history at all (works on bash 3 or avove)

# HISTIGNORE is a colon-delimited list of patterns which should be excluded.
# The '&' is a special pattern which suppresses duplicate entries.
export HISTIGNORE=$'[ \t]*:&:[fb]g:exit:ls:pwd:&:cd ~:cd ..:h:history' # Ignore the ls command as well

# append to the history file, don't overwrite it

#  number of commands to save in a history list.
# HISTSIZE: The number of commands to remember in the command history. The default value is 500.
